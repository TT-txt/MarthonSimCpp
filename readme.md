# Marathon Sim, written in CPP !
### Introduction
<p>This is the first project of my second in my ingeeniring degree, this one is about recreating a marathon simulation taking some paramaters and working in real time using <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>SFML</strong>. It is indeed pretty basic yet functionnal and has tons of intersting features.<br/>you can find out how to compile this under <a href="build/Infos.md">this file</a>.</p>

### Features
1. <a href="#I">Reading files in order to get and the runners and the marathon specs</a>
2. <a href="#II"> RNG?</a>
3. <a href="#III">Which parameters are changing the runner's speed ?</a>
4. a href="#IV">Export of the results</a>
5. <a href="#V">Side notes</a>

<h3 name="I"> Reading files in order to get and the runners and the marathon specs </h3>
You can use your own data in order to make the race: all you need to do is go under <a href="userFiles/participants.txt">userFiles/participants.txt</a>. In this place you are going to see a txt file constructed like this:</br>
```json
[...]       
{     
  name,     
  weight,     
  height,     
  shoes weight,   
  last marathon speed,    
  number of weeks of training (between 8 and 16)    
}   
[...]
```

<h3 name="II"> RNG ? </h3>
<p></p>
<h3 name="III"> Which parameters are changing the runner's speed ? </h3>
<p></p>
<h3 name="IV"> Export of the results </h3>
<p></p>
<h3 name="V"> Side notes </h3>
<p></p>
